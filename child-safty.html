  <h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 20, 2025</p>

  <p>
  Viewlio is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users, particularly minors.
  We do not allow any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on our platform and take proactive measures to prevent and report such content.
</p>

<h2>Our Standards</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We prohibit the posting or sharing of any CSAM, including implied or simulated content.</li>
  <li>All users must be at least 13 years old to use the app.</li>
  <li>We take action against reported accounts that violate these standards.</li>
  <li>We report confirmed CSAM content to relevant authorities and work with industry organizations as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting Process</h2>
<p>
  Users can report safety concerns, including suspected CSAM, directly through the app.
  Reports are reviewed promptly, and appropriate action is taken, including account suspension and reporting to appropriate authorities when necessary.
</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comments on a video (feedback) are only visible to the Spotlight owner.</li>
  <li>To report a comment, there is a button at the bottom of the detailed information of a Spotlight. You click the button and select the comment. However, we always prefer you to <strong>contact us via email</strong> for any concerns.</li>
  <li>Videos shown are from YouTube, and YouTube should be blocking inappropriate content.</li>
  <li>Auto moderation is in place when a user attempts to add a comment.</li>
</ul>


  <h2>Contact</h2>
