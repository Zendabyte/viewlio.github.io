Communications sent through other means — such as social media, app store reviews, or public forums — are not monitored for support purposes and will not be considered valid methods for resolving disputes.<br />
By using the Service, you agree to first attempt to resolve any concerns in good faith by contacting us via this email. We will make reasonable efforts to respond to and address legitimate concerns in a timely manner.<br />
We do not offer arbitration services, and we are not obligated to engage in formal litigation unless required by law. If no resolution is reached, we reserve the right to restrict or deny continued use of the Service at our sole discretion.</p>

<h2>13. User-Generated Content and Moderation</h2>
<p>You acknowledge that any content, including comments, posts, messages, or other materials ("User Content") posted by users on or through the Service are solely the responsibility of the person who made such content. We do not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for any User Content.<br />
While we strive to provide a safe and respectful environment and reserve the right to remove User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, we do not guarantee the immediate removal of such content.<br />
By using the Service, you agree that the Company is not liable for any User Content, including but not limited to offensive, defamatory, inaccurate, or inappropriate content posted by other users.

<h2>15. User Content License</h2>
<p>By submitting, posting, or displaying any User Content on or through the Service, you grant the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such content in connection with the Service and the Company’s business, including for promotional purposes. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This User Content License applies only to content that you submit, post, or display directly on or through the Service (e.g., comments, messages, or other materials). Videos hosted on third-party platforms such as YouTube, which are embedded in the Service, remain subject to the terms and licenses of those platforms, and the Company does not claim any ownership or license over such videos.</p>

<h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your violation of these Terms, misuse of the Service, or infringement of any rights of another.</p>

<h2>17. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, services, or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, content, or policies of such third parties. Your interactions with third-party services are solely between you and the third party.</p>

<h2>18. Termination or Discontinuation of Service</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>

<h2>19. Updates to the Service</h2>
<p>The Company may, from time to time, add, remove, or modify features, functionality, or content of the Service without prior notice. You acknowledge that the Company is not obligated to provide updates or support and may change the Service at its sole discretion.</p>

<h2>20. Feedback</h2>
<p>If you provide the Company with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Service, you hereby grant the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and otherwise commercialize such feedback without any compensation or obligation to you.</p>

<h2>21. Compliance with Laws</h2>
<p>You agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules when using the Service. You represent that you are not located in any country or region where the use of the Service is prohibited or restricted by law.</p>

<h2>22. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or other authority, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid provision that most closely reflects the original intent.</p>

<h2>23. Force Majeure</h2>
<p>The Company shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms due to causes beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of government, supplier failures, internet outages, technical issues, or other unforeseeable events.<br />
You acknowledge that the Service is maintained by an individual developer, not a full-time company, and as such, response times for support, maintenance, and issue resolution may be delayed. The Developer will make reasonable efforts to address valid concerns but cannot guarantee immediate responses or uninterrupted service.</p>

<h2>24. Children's Use</h2>
<p>The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). By using the Service, you represent that you are at least the minimum age required to form a binding contract or have parental/guardian consent.</p>

<h2>25. Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements or communications, whether oral or written.</p>

<h2>26. In-App Purchases and Refunds</h2>
<p>If the Service offers in-app purchases, subscriptions, or premium features, all payments are processed exclusively through the app store platforms (e.g., Google Play Store). We do not process or store your payment information directly.<br />
All purchases are final and non-refundable through the Service, except as required by applicable law or the respective app store’s refund policies.<br />
If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please request it directly through the app store from which you made the purchase:</p>

<h2>27. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
<p>The Service does not display third-party advertisements. However, it may use tools such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, or similar services for analytics, crash reporting, or performance monitoring. These tools use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymous usage data, which helps the Developer understand how the Service is used and improve its functionality and reliability.<br />
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of such data as described in the privacy policies of these third-party providers. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how your data may be handled.<br />

<p>If you post or submit content through the Service, you understand and agree that your data may be stored and processed using third-party services (such as databases, cloud hosting, or analytics tools).<br />
We use reasonable measures to protect your data, but cannot guarantee absolute security. By using the Service, you consent to your data being processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the laws of the Province of Quebec, Canada.</p>

<h2>29. Promotional Pricing</h2>
<p>Occasionally, the Service may offer promotional pricing, including limited-time discounts and sales. All strike-through prices or listed discounts represent the original price at which the product was previously offered and do not guarantee future pricing. Displayed percentage discounts are approximate and may be rounded for clarity. Promotions are subject to change or end at any time without notice. The Company does not guarantee the availability of any promotion and reserves the right to modify or cancel promotional offers at its sole discretion.</p>
